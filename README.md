# DiscogParser

Parses the huge "releases" export files from data.discogs.com and extracts
only data of the releases that are in the user's collection.

Output is in .json format.

Project is in raw and experimental state, and lacking many features and details.
Right now, even the names of input and output files are hard coded,
and everything is in a single main.cpp module.

There is also no documentation yet.

Relies on Qt 5.
